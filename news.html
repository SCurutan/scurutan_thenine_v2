                <h1>Safety Measures for Tokyo 2020</h1>
                <h5>Written by: Sabrina Curutan (April 12th, 2021)</h5>
                <h2 class="mt-4">Although the Summer Olympics were postponed from last August, the time is now upon us for the biggest rescheduled event in history. Japan is taking all of the necessary precautions to ensure athlete and public safety this coming July. One such step is banning all foreign fans and volunteers to keep travel and crowds to a minimum.</h2>

                <h2 class="mt-4">The Japanese public are strongly opposed to holding the Olympics, but the organizing committees have tried to compromise with them through the foreign fan restriction. The International Olympic Committee has promised refunds to fans that have purchased tickets outside of Japan.</h2> 
                  
                <h2 class="mt-4">The past year and a half has been unprecedented in sports and history as a whole. Let’s hope that holding the Tokyo Olympics will be on the right side of it.</h2>

                <h1>WNBA: Fighting the Good Fight </h1>
                <h5>Written by: Sabrina Curutan (March 8th, 2021)</h5>
                <h2 class="mt-4">Last summer the WNBA dedicated its season to Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was killed in her home in Louisville by a police officer. Every single player had her name stitched to the back of their jerseys in order to honour this young woman. New York Liberty guard Layshia Clarendon stated the importance of this dedication as “black women […] are so often forgotten in this fight for justice, who do not have people marching in the streets for them. We will say her name.”</h2>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Today, players are still fighting for justice and continue to say her name so that she will not be forgotten. They continue to be a voice for the voiceless and use their platform to bring awareness to the violence that is happening in the United States. The WNBA will ensure that Breonna Taylor will never be forgotten.</h2>

                <h5>Written by: Sabrina Curutan (April 10th, 2021)</h5>
                <h2 class="mt-4">A federal judge approved a partial deal between players on the US women’s national team and the US Soccer Federation over unequal working conditions. This legal battle has been two years in the making for the grander scheme of things that has been generations in the making.</h2>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Led by striker Megan Rapinoe, this group of women have been fighting for equitable conditions that include charter flights, hotel accommodations, venue selection, professional support staff, and most importantly equal pay to the US Men’s Team.  The US Women’s Team won the most recent World Cup in 2019 and is currently ranked number one in the world whereas the men’s team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. These women have been able to accomplish more with less funds, resources, and support. With this partial deal, they are on track to claim what is rightfully theirs.</h2>
